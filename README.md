# Bootstrap Template
This is a very simple bootstrap template with a sticky footer and fontawesome - for beginners. New learners of bootstrap might find it useful before they dig into topics such as sass, npm, etc.

## Included
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Popper
- FontAwesome

## CDNs
You will be able to run dependecies via `cdn`s or locally. This makes it easy to develop whether you are connected to the Internet or not. Have fun ...

## Next Level
If you want to manage dependencies using `npm` with the ability to use ES6 and Sass and minify CSS and JS files, have a look at my other repository <a href="https://github.com/Khuthaily/bootstrap-mix"> *bootstrap-mix*</a>.
